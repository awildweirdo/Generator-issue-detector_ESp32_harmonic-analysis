# Generator-issue-detector_ESp32_harmonic-analysis

Create a simple transformer troubleshooter using harmonic analysis
esp32 takes input from voltage and current sensor that samples voltage and current data from transformer. send this data to a PC via wifi (https)
a simple python script was made to plot this and perform fourier transform (Use FFT) to identify harmonics and identify relevent issues


#testing the python code
the sample code plots a sample data that woild help test the plots and issue identification
